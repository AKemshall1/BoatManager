# BoatManager
A windows program made to practice MVVM, WPF and SQL. Handles CRUD operations.

Created to build familiarlity with WPF, SQL and MVVM. Worked through the first 10 episodes of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0wefbX90CmYNrO67FtZNDlnSrmWkF4bJ).

Skills learnt:

* Basic XAML
